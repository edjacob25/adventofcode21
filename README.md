# Advent of Code 2021

This repo contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) event, this year the solution will be on Rust  as it id the language I'd like to practice most.
I will try to only the standard library as far as I can, but I may use external crates if aplicable.
